# Axonibyte Java Library Suite - Authentication

Copyright (c) 2023 Axonibyte Innovations, LLC. All rights reserved.

This Java library handles encryption, decryption, signing, verification, key
expansion, and hashing for various Axonibyte and partner services. In general,
cryptographic libraries can be a lot to handle in terms of implementation, and
repeated implementations violate the DRY principle. This wrapper alleviates the
difficulties related to properly configuring and handling cryptogrpahic
workflows in the manner standardized by Axonibyte's Research Division.
